                <h3>Chapter 4: "Achieve Your Goals"</h3>
                <p>In this chapter, they talk about how setting goals is not just about reaching a destination but about who you 
                    become while working toward it. Michael learns from Charlie that goals help shape our character and push us 
                    to grow. This really spoke to me because, as an animation student, I often feel unsure about where I want my 
                    career to go. Some days I want to work in film, other days I imagine doing character design. Reading this made 
                    me realize that even if I don’t know the final goal yet, I can still set small, meaningful ones. These smaller 
                    steps can guide me toward clarity, help me build discipline, and maybe even reveal what part of animation I truly 
                    love.

                <h3>Chapter 5: "The Proper Use of Time"</h3>
                <p>Focuses on the difference between the “pain of discipline” and the “pain of regret.” Charlie reminds Michael that every day gives us opportunities, 
                    but only a few truly align with our goals. This lesson hit home for me because managing time is something I struggle with. Between schoolwork, 
                    personal projects, and distractions, it’s easy for me to feel like the day slips away without progress. In animation, everything takes time; drawing, 
                    editing, and revising scenes can stretch for hours, so discipline is everything. This chapter reminded me that I need to plan my time more carefully and
                    treat each day as a chance to get better. I’d rather push myself now, even when it’s hard, than look back later wishing I had practiced more or taken 
                    my studies seriously.

                <h3>Chapter 6: "Surround Yourself with the Best People"</h3>
                <p>This chapter explores how the people around us can shape our mindset and future. Charlie encourages Michael to think about who he
                    spends the most time with and how those people influence his thoughts and habits. That made me stop and think about my own circle.
                    In creative fields like animation, it’s easy to feel stuck if you’re around people who complain or don’t care about improving.
                    ’ve realized that I need to be around people who push me to do better, classmates who challenge me creatively, mentors who share
                    advice, and even online artists who inspire me. Being surrounded by positive, driven people makes me want to grow too. This 
                    chapter made me understand that if I want to reach a higher level, I have to put myself in environments that bring out my best
                    self.

                <h3>Chapter 7: "Be a Life-Long Learner"</h3>
                <p>Is about the importance of continuous learning. Charlie tells Michael that while formal education helps you make a living, 
                    self-education helps you make a life. That line really stood out to me. As a student, it’s easy to rely on what’s taught in 
                    class, but the world of animation is constantly evolving. New tools, techniques, and styles come out all the time. This chapter 
                    encouraged me to take learning into my own hands, to read books, study tutorials, and learn from other artists. I realized that 
                    curiosity should never end just because school assignments do. If I keep learning and experimenting, I’ll not only improve my skills
                    but also gain a clearer sense of direction about where I want to take my career.
