                <h3> Drawing </h3>
                    Drawing is one of my main hobbies and it reflects my creativity and imagination. It helps me think visually and approach school assignments 
                    with originality. This skill allows me to develop ideas more effectively and present my academic work in creative and thoughtful ways.

                    <h3> Makeup </h3>
                    Doing makeup shows my attention to detail and precision. The process requires careful colour coordination and focus, which helps me produce neat, 
                    well-organized assignments. It also encourages me to take pride in the quality and presentation of my schoolwork.

                     <h3> Nails </h3>
                    Doing nails has taught me patience and discipline because it requires time and concentration to achieve good results. This patience helps me stay
                    focused during studying and complete academic tasks carefully instead of rushing through them.

            <h3 class="resume-heading"> MY HERO- All Might</h3>

            <p> One of the heroes I look up to the most is All Might from one of my <a href="#anim">Top 3 Anime</a> series My Hero Academia. All Might, whose real name is Toshinori Yagi, is known as the 
                world’s greatest superhero and the “Symbol of Peace.” In the story, he represents hope, courage, and reassurance during times of fear and uncertainty. 
                Despite carrying serious injuries and personal struggles, he continues to protect others with unwavering determination and a strong sense of responsibility.
                <br><br>

                My favourite quote from him is, “It is fine now. Why? Because I am here!” Whenever this line is spoken in the anime, it immediately puts citizens’ minds at 
                ease because they know that All Might’s presence means safety and justice. His confidence reassures people that their problems will be resolved, while also
                 striking fear into villains. As the number one hero, he inspires an entire generation of young heroes to be brave, selfless, and compassionate.
                 <br><br>

                What makes All Might my hero is not only his strength but also his character. He teaches that being a true hero is about protecting others, smiling even in 
                difficult moments, and giving people hope. His role as a symbol of peace shows the importance of leadership, sacrifice, and inspiring others to become their
                best selves. Through his actions and words, All Might demonstrates that true heroism comes from courage and kindness rather than power alone.</p>

            <h3 class="resume-heading"> Report: AI Businesses of 2025- AI-based smart home management</h3>
                <p>
                    My favourite idea from the AI Businesses of 2025 blog is AI-based smart home management. This idea can be applied to my world through
                    improving both comfort and home aesthetics. Since I have a strong interest in home decor, 
                    AI smart home systems would allow me to customize lighting colour, warmth, and brightness to match different moods or interior designs.
                    Additionally, the ability to turn appliances on or off remotely and automatically adjust energy usage would help reduce electricity costs 
                    and improve energy efficiency. Security monitoring features would also make a home safer by detecting unusual activity and sending alerts
                    to homeowners. A comfortable and secure home environment supports productivity and overall well-being. <br><br>

                    However, ethical concerns include privacy risks and potential hacking, since smart devices collect personal data about daily 
                    routines. To address this, companies should use strong data encryption, clear privacy policies, and give users control over their 
                    data. Homeowners should also practice good cybersecurity habits, such as updating devices regularly and using strong passwords. <br><br>

                    An example of an app in this area is the Google Home app, which allows users to control smart devices and create automated routines. 
                    The website for the app is: <a href="https://home.google.com/welcome/"> Google Home</a>
